## Dijkstra's Algorithm for Shortest Paths

**Finding the Shortest Path:**

Given a weighted graph, where each edge has an associated cost, Dijkstra's
algorithm efficiently determines the shortest path between a source node and all
other nodes in the graph. This path represents the sequence of edges that
minimizes the total cost of travel.

**The Algorithm:**

Dijkstra's algorithm operates in two primary phases:

1. **Relaxation:** The algorithm iteratively explores neighboring nodes,
   updating their tentative distances from the source node if a shorter path is
   discovered. It maintains a priority queue to prioritize visiting nodes with
   the most promising current distances.
2. **Settling Nodes:** As the algorithm progresses, nodes are "settled," meaning
   their shortest distances from the source have been finalized. Settled nodes
   are no longer considered for further exploration.

**Key Concepts:**

- **Distance:** Represents the cumulative cost of traversing a path from the
  source node.
- **Tentative Distance:** An estimate of the shortest distance from the source
  to a particular node, which may be updated as better paths are discovered.
- **Priority Queue:** This data structure prioritizes nodes based on their
  tentative distances, ensuring that the most promising neighbors are explored
  first.

**Benefits of Dijkstra's Algorithm:**

- **Efficient for Shortest Paths:** Dijkstra's algorithm efficiently finds the
  shortest paths in weighted graphs, making it a valuable tool for route
  planning, network optimization, and various graph-related applications.
- **Adaptable to Edge Costs:** The algorithm can handle graphs where edge costs
  represent different metrics like distance, time, or resource consumption.

**Trade-offs of Dijkstra's Algorithm:**

- **Limited to Non-Negative Costs:** Dijkstra's algorithm assumes non-negative
  edge costs. For graphs with negative edge costs, modifications or alternative
  algorithms like Bellman-Ford are needed.
- **Memory Overhead:** Maintaining the priority queue introduces some memory
  overhead compared to simpler graph traversal algorithms.

**Choosing Dijkstra's Algorithm:**

Dijkstra's algorithm is the preferred method when finding the shortest paths in
weighted graphs with non-negative edge costs. Its efficiency and adaptability
make it a versatile tool for various applications involving shortest path
computations.
