## Floyd's Algorithm for All-Pairs Shortest Paths

**Finding Shortest Paths for All Pairs:**

Floyd's algorithm, also known as the Floyd-Warshall algorithm, tackles the
all-pairs shortest-paths problem in weighted graphs. Unlike Dijkstra's
algorithm, which finds the shortest path from a single source to all other
nodes, Floyd's algorithm efficiently calculates the shortest paths between every
pair of nodes in the graph.

**The Algorithm's Approach:**

Floyd's algorithm employs a dynamic programming strategy. It iteratively
considers all possible intermediate nodes that a shortest path between two nodes
might pass through. It progressively refines the shortest paths by incorporating
these intermediate nodes.

**Key Concepts:**

- **Distance Matrix:** A matrix that stores the current shortest distances
  between all pairs of nodes in the graph. It is updated throughout the
  algorithm's execution.
- **Intermediate Node:** A node that can potentially be part of the shortest
  path between two other nodes.
- **Dynamic Programming:** An optimization technique that solves problems by
  breaking them down into subproblems and storing the solutions to reuse them
  efficiently.

**Benefits of Floyd's Algorithm:**

- **Comprehensive Shortest Paths:** Provides the shortest distances between
  every pair of nodes in the graph, making it suitable for network analysis and
  routing problems where all possible connections are of interest.
- **Handles Negative Edge Weights (except cycles):** Unlike Dijkstra's
  algorithm, Floyd's algorithm can handle graphs with negative edge weights, as
  long as there are no negative-weight cycles.

**Trade-offs of Floyd's Algorithm:**

- **Higher Time Complexity:** Compared to Dijkstra's algorithm, Floyd's
  algorithm has a higher time complexity (O(n^3)) due to its consideration of
  all possible intermediate nodes. This can be a disadvantage for very large
  graphs.
- **Memory Overhead:** The algorithm requires storing the distance matrix, which
  can consume significant memory for dense graphs.

**Choosing Floyd's Algorithm:**

Floyd's algorithm is a powerful tool when you need the shortest paths between
all node pairs in a weighted graph, especially if negative edge weights are
present (excluding negative-weight cycles). However, for scenarios where only
the shortest path from a single source is required, or for very large graphs,
Dijkstra's algorithm might be a more suitable choice due to its lower
complexity.
