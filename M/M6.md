# Stacks

Stacks are a fundamental data structure that follow the "Last In, First Out" (LIFO) principle. Imagine a stack of plates: the last plate added is the first one to be removed. Stacks are used in various applications like function call handling, browser history management, and expression evaluation. Similar to queues, they can be implemented using both arrays and linked lists.

## Stack with Array

An array-based stack utilizes a standard array to store elements. It keeps track of a single pointer, often called "top," which points to the topmost element in the stack (the one to be removed).

**Common Stack Operations (Array):**

* **Push:** Adds an element to the top of the stack. (O(1))
* **Pop:** Removes the element from the top of the stack. (O(1))
* **GetTop:** Returns the element at the top of the stack without removing it. (O(1))

## Stack with Linked List

A linked list-based stack offers more flexibility as it doesn't have a fixed size limit. Each element (data) is stored in a node, along with a pointer to the next node in the sequence. The stack maintains a single reference:

* **top:** Points to the first node in the stack (the one to be removed).

**Common Stack Operations (Linked List):**

* **Push:** Adds an element to the top of the stack. (O(1))
* **Pop:** Removes the element from the top of the stack. (O(1))
* **GetTop:** Returns the element at the top of the stack without removing it. (O(1))


**Choosing the Right Stack Implementation:**

* If you know the maximum stack size upfront and prioritize fast push/pop operations, an array-based stack might be sufficient.
* If frequent insertions/deletions from the top or dynamic size is crucial, a linked list-based stack offers more flexibility.

# Queues

Queues are a fundamental data structure that follow the "First In, First Out" (FIFO) principle. Imagine a line at a store; the person who arrives first gets served first. Queues are used in various applications like task scheduling, processing requests, and managing buffers. They can be implemented using both arrays and linked lists.

## Queue with Array

An array-based queue utilizes a standard array to store elements. It keeps track of two pointers:

* **front:** Points to the element at the front of the queue (the first one to be removed).
* **rear:** Points to the position where the next element will be inserted (one element after the last element).

**Common Queue Operations (Array):**

* **Enqueue:** Adds an element to the back of the queue. (O(1))
* **Dequeue:** Removes the element from the front of the queue. (O(1))
* **IsEmpty:** Checks if the queue is empty. (O(1))
* **GetFront:** Returns the element at the front of the queue without removing it. (O(1))

**Note:** In an array-based queue, as elements are dequeued, empty spaces are left at the beginning of the array. To avoid wasting space and improve efficiency, a circular queue implementation can be used, but it adds complexity.

## Queue with Linked List

A linked list-based queue offers more flexibility as it doesn't have a fixed size limit. Each element (data) is stored in a node, along with a pointer to the next node in the sequence. The queue maintains two references:

* **front:** Points to the first node in the queue (the one to be removed).
* **rear:** Points to the last node in the queue.

**Common Queue Operations (Linked List):**

* **Enqueue:** Adds an element to the back of the queue. (O(1))
* **Dequeue:** Removes the element from the front of the queue. (O(1))
* **GetFront:** Returns the element at the front of the queue without removing it. (O(1))


**Choosing the Right Queue Implementation:**

* If you know the maximum queue size upfront and prioritize fast enqueue/dequeue at the end (common scenario), an array-based queue might be sufficient.
* If frequent insertions/deletions from both ends or dynamic size is crucial, a linked list-based queue offers more flexibility.
