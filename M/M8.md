## Binary Search Trees (BSTs)

Binary Search Trees (BSTs) are a fundamental data structure that efficiently organize and access sorted data. They are tree-based structures where each node contains a key value and pointers to left and right child nodes.

**Properties of BSTs:**

* **Ordering:** For any node, all keys in its left subtree are less than its key, and all keys in its right subtree are greater than its key.
* **Uniqueness:** No duplicate keys are allowed within a BST.

**Operations on BSTs:**

* **Search:** The search operation leverages the ordering property. We compare the target key with the current node's key and traverse either left (for smaller keys) or right (for larger keys) based on the comparison result. This allows for efficient search, typically with a time complexity of O(log n) in the average case, where n is the number of elements in the tree.
* **Insertion:** New elements are inserted in their respective positions based on the ordering property, maintaining the BST structure.
* **Deletion:** Deleting an element involves finding the node to be removed, handling cases like nodes with no children, one child, or two children, and ensuring the BST remains valid after the deletion.

**Applications of BSTs:**

* **Implementing sorted sets:** BSTs are efficient for maintaining sorted collections of data, enabling fast retrieval and insertion operations based on key values.
* **Autocompletion:** BSTs can be used to implement autocompletion features in search bars or text editors, providing suggestions based on the partially entered prefix.
* **Data compression:** Techniques like Huffman coding utilize BSTs to represent frequently occurring characters with shorter codes, achieving data compression.

**Beyond the Basics:**

* **Balanced BSTs:** Techniques like AVL trees and Red-Black trees address potential performance issues in unbalanced BSTs, ensuring logarithmic search and insertion times even for worst-case scenarios.
* **BST Traversals:** In-order traversal of a BST results in a sorted list of elements, which is useful in various applications. Pre-order and post-order traversals can also be performed for specific use cases.
